	Hunt the Wumpus is a simple console adventure game in which the player navigates through a maze and tries to kill a Wumpus.
    Each turn the player is given a description of where he is, and what directions he can move in. He is then asked to choose an action.

    Legal actions are:
    E: Go East
    W: Go West
    N: Go North
    S: Go South
    R: Rest for one turn
    SE: Shoot Arrow East
    SW: Shoot Arrow West
    SN: Shoot Arrow North
    SS: Shoot Arrow South

    * You can’t always move in all directions. If you try the game will say: “You can’t go {east|west|north|south} from here”
    * If you move into a cavern with the wumpus, or if the wumpus moves into your cavern while you are resting, you die, and the game is over.
    * If you shoot in a direction, the arrow will continue to go in that direction until it hits a wall, or the wumpus.
          o If the arrow passes through the cavern that contains the wumpus, it dies, and you win.
          o If the arrow hits a wall, it stays in that cavern.
          o If you move into a cavern that has an arrow, you automatically pick it up.
          o If you shoot in a direction that does not exist, the arrow bounces back and kills you.
    * Some caverns have pits.
          o If you are near a cavern that has a pit, you will “hear wind”.
          o If you move into a cavern with a pit, you fall in and die.
    * Some caverns have bats.
          o If you are near a cavern that has bats you will “hear chirping”.
          o If you move into a cavern with bats, the bats pick you up and drop you at a random location in the maze.
                + The bats then return to the original cavern.
    * The wumpus moves randomly every turn.
          o It moves through the maze, it does not teleport.
          o It sometimes rests.
          o If you are near the wumpus you will “smell the wumpus”.
